# Mary & Shad : Investigations

Hi! I'm David HENG, a computer scientist student and for my Android project, I'm working on an Investigation game with a huge inspiration from Ace Attorney series.
 **Mary & Shad : Invesigations** is born from the idea to offer an easy gameplay where you don't need to rotate your phone into landscape mode.
 
For now the project is still WIP so it lacks a lot of the features T_T


## Controllers

The main control for moving the Mary or Shad is a **virtual joystick** put in right-down of the screen to make an easy movement with the thumb of your hand !
Some interactive buttons will appear when the character need to analyse, talk or switch ;)

## Home made sprites

For now, my idea is also to draw my own sprite for this game. Firstly, because I don't want any right trouble with someone else work ~ ! (more important when you want to launch the app on Google Play right ?)

## Home made music ?

I'm literally a noob for music production, but I really want to learn how to make simple song with my computer. So for now music is not my priority but I really want to make a good atmosphere with the music :)
